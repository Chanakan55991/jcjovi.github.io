# How to contribute to Jovi's Noteland
## First Steps
Well hello, and welcome to the world of code.

For sure, you will need a Github account. I think you are smart enough to know how to sign up for one.

Next, you will need a markdown editor to edit your note files. For that, I recommend [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for macOS users and [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) for Windows and Linux users. You could also go with Inkdrop, which is what I use, if you are good enough to create a plugin for the app, or pay $4.99 per month.

## Next steps
The following steps are fairly easy to understand with video, so I've left some links for you to refer to.
